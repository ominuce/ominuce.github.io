###### terrain vagues, *Lucile Thierry, 3D, 2016*

*terrain vagues* is an *in situ* piece that never was. In a room, a garden, or a waste ground, *Terrain Vagues* offers the experience of walking on a concrete sea of melted buildings. The piece should never be built for ecological reasons. A piece that deeply addresses issues of material waste and ecology should not be made from such materials.
