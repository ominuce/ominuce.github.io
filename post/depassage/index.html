Both an exhibition and a game, <em>De passage</em> casts a misty eye on the hypotheses of societal collapse.</p><p><em>De passage</em> is an evocation of a mad spirit, that of the architect who slumbers in each of us and who dreams of a human permanence that has become impossible. This mad spirit, against all odds, develops a utopian form to accommodate its aspiration. <em>De passage</em> is a double visit, a journey to the border of incompatible eras.</p><p><em>De passage: Exploration</em> is the digital interface to which you are invited on itch.io: A traveller treads the synthetic ground of an artificial hill. In front of him, a suspended space. The only sound of the city he sees is the song of thousands of birds. Streetlights faintly pierce the sea mist. An invitation to discover, their light draws a path. <em>Exploration</em> invites the visitor-traveller to explore the city of Lierre (Ivy) in a digital space, between ruin and construction site, at a time when the discreet presence of the Architect is still felt. Satellite remnants, mobile lampposts and heliotropic buildings are all archaeological remains of a dislocated history.</p><p><em>De passage: Appartement</em> is the immersive installation developed at the art centre Chantier Public in Poitiers: Appartement is situated in a more distant, even more unknown time. Chantier Public opens up to visitors and reveals a dwelling, a quasi-museal space that reveals the last remnants of the Architect&rsquo;s life and his project. Outside, all that remains, like all traces of a humanity that has become myth, are strange missives with no real addressees, lost letters carried by the ultimate couriers that birds have become.</p><p><img src=appartement1.jpg alt="Extract of De passage"></p><h6 id=de-passage-appartement-installation-marianne-vieulès-vincent-kosellek-lucile-thierry>De passage: appartement <em>installation Marianne Vieulès, Vincent Kosellek, Lucile Thierry</em></h6></article></main><footer><a href=mailto:lucile.thierry@protonmail.com>Contact</a></footer></body></html>
