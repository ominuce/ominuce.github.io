###### monades 1 *Lucile Thierry, photography, 120x60 cm, 2017*

*monades* is a series of six photographs. Each one shows a different arrangement of files on a hard drive.

The point was to create landscapes with non-pictorial information: files on a hard drive. Traditionally, pictorial landscapes have some rules, such as the land/sky proportion must respect a 1/3-2/3 ratio.

In *monades*, files take the place of skies, seas and buildings.
