###### Concept art of the guide of the ghost, Sebastian Pastor, 2022

In Togs Memories, you play as a ghost who is trying to become human again. On the night of the Day of the Dead, you must steal clothes from people's houses in order to do so.

As a ghost, you have certain limitations that you must navigate in order to achieve your goal. You cannot pass through light or magic barriers, and you are unable to pass through walls when wearing clothes.

To become human again, you must explore a neighborhood and find the best clothes to create your identity. This puzzle game is not just about the challenges you face, but also about themes of identity, death, and the role that clothes play in our lives.
